= Lab 2 starting point

* client.c: starting point for client-side
* server.c: starting point for server-side
* cs87talk.[c,h]:  starting point for common messaging functions used
                  by both client and server, and shared definitions
                  (functions that send and receive messages should be
                  defined here, and called from client and server code)
* Makefile:
   ** make: builds cs87_client and cs87_server executables
+
note that currently there are some unused variable warnings for variables
I've defined for you that you will want to use in your code, or that are
used in some of the example code commented out in the .c files.

   ** make clean : removes all compiler built files
